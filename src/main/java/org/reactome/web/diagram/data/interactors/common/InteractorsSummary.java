/**
 * This class is used for caching purposes. When displaying the summary item, related to the interactors of a
 * certain diagram entity node (TR), the number and the status (pressed or not) are taken directly from the
 * layout object. Since we want to keep the previous data cached (to avoid reloading 'known data' but also to
 * improve the performance) the best way of doing is 'replicating' it and storing separately in the content.
 *
 * Note 1: This object has been added as an attribute to the 'Node' class (layout data package). The reason
 * why is to avoid having to search for them once a interactor summary item is clicked (Having a pointer is
 * way faster than searching for it in a Set).
 *
 * Note 2: The pointer from the 'Node' class has to be updated when the resource is changed.
